# Personalized Recipe Recommender with Nutritional Optimization

This project is a personalized recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes based on user preferences, health goals, and nutritional optimization. It uses a dataset of recipes and applies various filters to recommend the best recipes that match the user's health goals (e.g., low-carb, high-protein, balanced). It also allows for the optimization of recipes based on nutritional values.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks (for `.ipynb` notebooks)
- Pandas, NumPy, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

To install the required Python dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. **Step 1**: Data Exploration  
   Open `01_data_exploration.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the `RAW_recipes.csv` dataset. This step involves understanding the dataset structure and cleaning it if necessary.

2. **Step 2**: User Input Collection  
   Open `02_user_input.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to collect user preferences. The notebook collects information such as health goals (e.g., low-carb, high-protein, balanced) and calorie budget. Save the preferences in the `user_input.json` file.

3. **Step 3**: Recipe Filtering  
   Open `03_recipe_filtering.ipynb` to filter recipes based on user preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, specific ingredients). The filtered data is saved as `filtered_user_recipes.csv`.

4. **Step 4**: Nutritional Optimization  
   Open `04_nutritional_optimization.ipynb` to optimize recipes based on the user's health goals (low-carb, high-protein, balanced). The output of this step is stored in `optimized_recipes.csv`, containing the most nutrition-optimized recipes.

5. **Step 5**: Recipe Recommendation  
   After generating the optimized recipes and user input files, run the Python script `recommend_recipes.py` to get the top 3 recommended recipes based on the user's health goals.

   To run the recipe recommendation script, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python src/recommend_recipes.py
   ```

   This script reads the `user_input.json` and `optimized_recipes.csv` files and prints the top 3 recommended recipes according to the health goal specified by the user.

### Example of Running the Recommendation

Hereâ€™s a basic usage example for recommending recipes:

```bash
$ python src/recommend_recipes.py
Top 3 Recommended Recipes based on your health goals:
                         name  fitness_score  calories  ingredients
0         Recipe Name 1          0.85      200     ['ingredient1', 'ingredient2']
1         Recipe Name 2          0.80      250     ['ingredient3', 'ingredient4']
2         Recipe Name 3          0.75      180     ['ingredient5', 'ingredient6']
```

### File Description for Recipe Recommendations

- **user_input.json**: This file stores the user's health goals (e.g., low-carb, high-protein) and calorie budget.
- **optimized_recipes.csv**: Contains recipes that have been optimized for nutritional value according to the user's health goals.

The `recommend_recipes.py` script uses these files to generate personalized recipe recommendations.

## Future Improvements

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement collaborative filtering to recommend recipes based on user preferences and reviews.
- **User Feedback**: Add a user feedback mechanism to improve recommendations over time.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implement more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as regression models or neural networks, to predict the best recipes for users based on their preferences.
